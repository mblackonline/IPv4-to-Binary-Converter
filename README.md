# IPv4-to-Binary-Converter
- This is a simple Python script that lets you convert an IPv4 address from decimal to binary. 
- I completed the proect to get some practice using functions, control flow, and try/except statements. 
- I've purposely kept the code as simple as possible to make it easy to follow and understand.
